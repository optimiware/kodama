# Changelog

## 0.1.0

The first public release.

Deployment targets:

- Single host on rootless Podman, and Kubernetes through the Helm charts.
- Scaleway is the only cloud target that has run live. AWS and GCP are
  implemented and not validated against a real cloud.

Known limitations:

- Git ref deletes are refused, also where `RW+` allows them.
- There is no public query for referenced commits; retained commits are
  protected by the control plane's keep-refs.
- Human and browser NATS subscriptions are refused; humans read events and
  logs over HTTP or MCP.
- The `webhook` and `email` service kinds deliver nothing outbound;
  email-to-task intake works.
- A workload start the runtime refuses leaves the execution `running` until
  its action deadline, and the cause is not shown in the execution view.
- The reference Scaleway configuration backs up every 6 hours, which misses
  the recommended RPO of 15 minutes.
- No service has been resumed from a restored database on a cloud deployment,
  so there is no measured RTO.
- The image is linux/amd64 only. Artifacts are not signed.
